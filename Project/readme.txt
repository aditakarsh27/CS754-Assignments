Data- mnist1.mat

Two main code files-
1. MyMainScript.m for generating the estimated covariance matrix and observing its trends with different parameters. Uses estimator.m for the matrix estimation.
2. classify.m for obtaining bases for all the digits and classifying 10,000 images into their digits. Uses estimator.m for the matrix estimation and predict_number for predicting the digit for a given image.
